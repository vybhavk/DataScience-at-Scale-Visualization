<br>Steps followed in Tableau for Data visualization<br>
1)Drag what ever the rows we need to represent in graph to the Row field.<br>
2)Drag the fields to the Column field.<br>
3) we can create filter by using some columns.<br>

Ex: 1) Drag "Number of Records" from measures to rows.<br>
2) Drag "Hour(time)" from dimensions to columns. By default, this will be aggregated to Hour.<br>
3) we can create filter by using some columns like catagory or district column. <br>
